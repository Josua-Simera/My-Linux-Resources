-	Configure Ubuntu on Jetson to not prompt for password on sudo:
	-	sudo gedit -w /etc/sudoers
	-	add "NOPASSWD:" on all lines ex: "ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL"

Following this link for setup on USB boot:

-	Follow Getting Started guide for Jetson to get OS image on to SD card
	-	Once booted into new OS, follow guide linked below
	-	Don't sudo apt update/upgrade yet, only after OS is on SSD, and first remove unwanted software packages

-	Grab following folder from Github
	-	git clone https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/rootOnUSB
	-	cd rootOnUSB

-	Build the initramfs with USB support, so that USB is available early in the boot process.
	-	sudo ./addUSBToInitramfs.sh

- 	Use the Disks application in ubuntu on the Jetson to format the SSD, it has to be ext4 format, NTFS won't work

-	Make sure the newly formated SSD is mounted on the system
	-	double click on the disk in the left toolbar
	-	In "Disks" utility, check where the disk is mounted (/media/...)

-	Now run the copy shell script and specify the path to the SSD
	-	sudo ./copyRootToUSB.sh -p /media/pathtodisk (OR /dev/sda, but didn't work for me)

-	In new terminal, navigate to current OS (SD card) boot directory
	-	cd /boot/extlinux

-	Create backup of file:
	-	sudo cp extlinux.conf extlinux.conf.original 

-	in /rootOnUSB/ directory, run to get SSD UUID and generate command to point to root
	-	sudo ./diskUUID.sh 

-	Edit configuration file with text editor
	-	sudo gedit extlinux.conf
	-	copy boot sequence (from LABEL onwards)
	-	rename copied sequence "sdcard" (replacing "primary")

-	configure new boot sequence to include USB driver
	-	INITRD /boot/initrd-xusb.img
	-	copy boot arguments from terminal in previous step (replacing APPEND onwards)
	-	 Save file and close, check if changes were accepted

-	Now shutdown, power cycle, and start up waiting for moment of truth

-	From now on, the system only boots up with both SD Card and SSD connected
